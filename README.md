YASB Dotfile Grabber

Yasb dotfile grabber is a simple utility to grab your config.yaml and styles.css.

It Grabs from both C:/Users/(username)/.config/yasb and 
C:/Users/(username)/Appdata/Local/Yasb

i dont know how useful this is, but it was a nice little programming challenge for me :)

INSTRUCTIONS:

Download this repo as a .zip and extract wherever

then run dotfilegrabber.exe and it should open a gui for you to use :)

it spits both styles.css & config.yaml into the Documents directory,

(C:/Users/(username)/Documents)

Written in Python & PowerShell Script :)
